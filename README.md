# API Aggregation

## Overview
The **API Aggregation Service** is a .NET-based application that consolidates data from multiple external APIs into a unified JSON response. It demonstrates effective API integration, asynchronous programming, error handling, and best practices for scalability and performance.

---

## External APIs Used

1. **OpenWeatherMap API**
   - Provides weather data for various locations worldwide.
   - [Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)

2. **News API**
   - Offers access to headlines and articles from global news sources.
   - [Documentation](https://newsapi.org/)

3. **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API**
   - Supplies daily images and metadata from NASAâ€™s APOD service.
   - [Documentation](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api)

## Input Parameters

The API accepts the following query parameters:

| Parameter    | Type     | Description                                                | Example Value      |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `startDate`  | DateOnly | The start date for data aggregation.                        | `2025-01-10`       |
| `endDate`    | DateOnly | The end date for data aggregation.                          | `2025-01-11`       |
| `keyword`    | string   | A keyword to filter news articles.                         | `Athens`           |
| `sortDateBy` | string   | Specifies how to sort the results by date (`asc` or `desc`).| `asc`              |
| `sortNewsBy` | string   | Specifies how to sort news articles (`relevance`, `popularity`).| `popularity`     |

### Notes:
- Dates must be provided in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Ensure all input parameters are valid; otherwise, the API may return an error.

## Expected Output Format

The API returns a JSON array where each object represents a single date and its aggregated data:

```json
[
  {
    "Date": "2025-01-10",
    "Weather": {
      "min": 12.12,
      "max": 18.18,
      "afternoon": 17.32,
      "night": 12.88,
      "evening": 15.52,
      "morning": 12.39
    },
    "AstronomyPictureOfTheDay": {
      "copyright": "Long Xin",
      "date": "2025-01-10",
      "explanation": "An unassuming region in the constellation Taurus holds these dark and dusty nebulae...",
      "media_type": "image",
      "title": "Young Stars, Dark Nebulae",
      "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2501/B209V773Tau_1024.png"
    },
    "News": {
      "articles": [
        {
          "author": "Joe Hotchkiss, Augusta Chronicle",
          "title": "Snow, ice shuts down Richmond, Columbia counties. Here's what's closed",
          "description": "Thinking of driving on icy, slushy roads? Think again.",
          "url": "https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/weather/2025/01/10/winter-storm...",
          "publishedAt": "2025-01-10T16:59:03Z"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

## Unit Tests

This project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure functionality and reliability:

- **Null Responses Handling**: Verifies the system can handle null responses gracefully without breaking.
- **Data Integration Tests**: Ensures data from all three APIs is aggregated correctly.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Tests the API's ability to sort and filter data as specified by the query parameters.
- **Error Handling**: Simulates API failures to verify fallback mechanisms and error responses.

## Running the Project

### Clone the Repository

To start working with the project, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickSakellariou/ApiAggregator.git
cd ApiAggregator
```

## Set Up API Keys

Before running the project, set up the necessary API keys in the `secrets.json` configuration file. This file contains the details for the external APIs:

```json
{
  "ExternalApis": {
    "OpenWeatherMap": {
      "GeoUrl": "http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct",
      "BaseUrl": "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall/day_summary",
      "ApiKey": "yourApiKey"
    },
    "NewsApi": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything",
      "ApiKey": "yourApiKey"
    },
    "APODApi": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod",
      "ApiKey": "yourApiKey"
    }
  }
}
```
Make sure to replace the API keys in the `secrets.json` file with your actual keys if necessary.

## Build and Run the Project

Now, build and run the project using the following commands:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Access the API

Once the application is running, you can access the API at the following endpoint:

```http
GET https://localhost:7054/api/apiaggregation/aggregate?startDate=2025-01-10&endDate=2025-01-11&keyword=Athens&sortDateBy=asc&sortNewsBy=popularity
```

You can modify the query parameters (startDate, endDate, keyword, etc.) based on your needs.
